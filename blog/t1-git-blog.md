Version control let's you work on code whilst it is updated in real time on a branch, then commit that code to the master code once you are satisfied with all of the changes

Git keeps track of changes through cloning and push pulls of data and commits

GitHub is open source and it is widely used in the developer world. It allows you to link your pc to the web to run cloud like based application of version control...

To Array or Hash? And what's the difference?

14/12/2014

Okay, beginners, the first thing EDA's curriculum says about an array is that Arrays are the most fundamental kind of collection. This must make them good right? Well there is also this nifty thing called a hash, and I am going to break it down for you...

Firstly Arrays. These are ordered lists, of which you can store multiple variables of the same type in. The viriables on an array can be strings or ints or anything for that matter! Confused yet?

Well, arrays are actually there to make things easier. 

You can enter a list of 5 values in an array, and when you print the values, you can have them print in alphabetical order, numbered order, smallest to largest etc etc...

You use the values inside of an array by calling their numbered position.

Now something to remember, the default values of numeric array elements are set to zero, and reference elements are set to null. What this means is that you have 5 variables, the array reads this as 0,1,2,3,4. Yup, arrays count from 0. Easy!

Now for hashes....Okay, even i need more work on these but here goes...

Hashes are much like arrays in that they are lists, however you refer to a hashvalue by calling it by name, ulinke the numbered position you would call an array with.

For a hash, you need to create a hash table. This is much like an array however each value has 2 things inside of it. These 2 things are a value and a key, for example (Name, Frank) would represent the value "Name" with the key "Frank".

Okay, thats going to be it for me at this stage as im still learning about the ins and outs of these two. Im going to come back at a later date an update this though, wont leave you hanging. 

Back to the "coding" board.
