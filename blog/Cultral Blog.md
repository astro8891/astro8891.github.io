14/12/2014  Reflecting on my solo culture in Week 3

So far my experiance in phase 0 has been intense, intense time management, intense learning and intense enjoyment. Reflecting back week 1 was not as hectic as it should have been, but learning how to work the command line and git for the first time was really daunting.... 

Week 2 felt like a mountain of work. Learning html and css whilst building my own website which had to look respectible was a big challange. This difficulty was met with great enjoyment and satisfaction when I would refresh my browser and see each line of code come to light. 

Kicking off into week 3 I was pretty warn out from week 2 but somehow made it work. This week a more independant style of learning was expected as a breif rundown of C# was given and you were thrown into the deep end to solve challanges. One word..Google. 

I feel as if I am getting through so far! As I work fulltime and play sport, I feel like everytime I go to relax I force myself to pick up the computer and get back into the zone. This version of muddle combined with a resiliance to watch TV is keeping me in the game and with the 2 week break over Xmas, now is the time to re go over what we have already covered. I am hoping that the familiarity of past weeks is on my side and I emerge ready to take on weeks 4-9 with even more confidence than I have now.

So how has my experiance related to my leaning style? 

From the Gregorc learning style calculations (http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm), I've found that I am an overall abstract sequential learning style with strong concrete random attributes. What this means to me is that I work well when I can thoughrouly analyse a situation before making a decision, and that I like to apply a logical approach to solving problems. Additionally, I like to use my intuition, take risks and have access to references whilst always working in stimulating environments.

This agrees with the way I think about myself, and reinforces the way I have been learning, well, apart from the stimulating bit. At home on the couch is getting me by at the moment but I can imagine there will be a significant change when we all come on site and there is a great buzz around.

Additionally, I do disagree with the concrete random description in that it defines that my learning style likes to solve issues alone. I personally would much rather work constructively in a group than slave over a problem alone. I am a people person at heart and crave a stimulating and succesful team environment. 

Some changes I have made/ are in the process of making? Well, this week as i now have a break from work I am going to go into the EDA base and connect with some of my fellow Kakapo cohort on site. I really want to hear from these guys how they interperet things and in turn I can practice with them and learn more constructively than on my own.

Furthermore, I need to make a greater effort to pair with others. This just takes the act of asking the question. The Ruby stream seems pretty social at this point and the C# pretty quuiet. This week I will reach out to my fellow sharpies and try to connect atleast twice in a pairing session.   

Well, thats it for now, back to the "Coding" board.
