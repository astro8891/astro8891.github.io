What's your take on the EDA experience? What is your impression of EDA? 

-So far my experiance of EDA is that it is very self orientated. EDA gives you direction but takes a step back when i comes to holding your hand through the examples. I like this, i feel like i am learning more by getting through some struggles.

How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

I am all about learning, i love to feel like I am growing every day. It feels great to be looking forward to getting amongst the EDA culture.

 Have your expectations of EDA changed? 
 
 So far no?
 
Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

Only nervous to the extent of any limitations my subconcious puts on my ability to preform.
